# Clafoutis - GitOps powered Design System Generator üöÄ

Clafoutis is a powerful, automated design system generator that transforms your design tokens into production-ready code across multiple platforms.

Built on the [Design Tokens Community Group (DTCG) specification](https://tr.designtokens.org/), Clafoutis ensures your design system remains vendor-agnostic while maintaining industry standards.

## Why Clafoutis? ü§î

In today's AI-powered development environment, maintaining brand consistency between design and code at scale is crucial. Clafoutis bridges this gap by:

- **GitOps-First Approach**: Treat your design tokens like infrastructure code - version controlled, reviewable, and deployable
- **Industry Standard Compliant**: Built on the DTCG specification, ensuring your tokens are future-proof and portable
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Generate code for both design and development platforms from a single source of truth
- **Automated Workflows**: Reduce manual work and eliminate human error in token distribution

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Single Source of Truth**: Define your design tokens once, deploy everywhere
- **GitOps Integration**: Version control your design system alongside your codebase
- **Realtime Generation**: Transform tokens into platform-specific formats automatically
- **Recommended Starting Design Tokens**: We will be building a 'recommended' design token schema, allowing developers and designers to build their own design system from Day 1. See /tokens/\*.

## Supported Platforms üéØ

### Design Tools

- **Figma**: Generate variables and styles directly in your Figma files
  - [Documentation](https://github.com/Dessert-Labs/claf/blob/main/docs/figma/README.md)

### Development Frameworks

- **React/Tailwind**: Generate Tailwind configuration and React components
  - [Documentation](https://github.com/Dessert-Labs/claf/blob/main/docs/tailwind/README.md)

## Getting Started üöÄ

Coming soon.

## Why GitOps? üîÑ

GitOps has revolutionized how we manage infrastructure. We're bringing the same principles to design systems:

- **Version Control**: Track changes to your design system over time
- **Review Process**: Implement design changes through pull requests
- **Automated Deployments**: Deploy design updates with confidence
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain a clear history of design decisions
- **Collaboration**: Enable better collaboration between designers and developers

## Contributing ü§ù

We welcome contributions! Whether it's adding support for new platforms, improving documentation, or fixing bugs, your help makes Clafoutis better for everyone
